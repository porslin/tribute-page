            In 1970 Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for a lifetime of work to feed a hungry world.
            Although a scientist with outstanding contributions, perhaps Dr. Borlaug's greatest achievement has been his
            unending struggle to integrate the various streams of agricultural research into viable technologies and to
            convince political leaders to bring these advances to fruition.
